  abstract={We analyze Robinhood (RH) investors' trading reactions to intraday hourly and overnight price changes. Contrasting with recent studies focusing on daily behaviors, we find that RH users strongly favor big losers over big gainers. We also uncover that they react rapidly, typically within an hour, when acquiring stocks that exhibit extreme negative returns. Further analyses suggest greater (lower) attention to overnight (intraday) movements and exacerbated behaviors post-COVID-19 announcement. Moreover, trading attitudes significantly vary across firm size and industry, with a more contrarian strategy towards larger-cap firms and a heightened activity on energy and consumer discretionary stocks.},
